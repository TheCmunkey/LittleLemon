Testing 123

This was the worst course I have taken by Meta so far.

The instructions are confusing, and loaded with inconsistencies.

Of the 4 people I graded so far, only one of them  uploaded anything and he didn't follow the worthless instructions at all.

The second person posted a link to a blank github repo.

And the other 2 posted links to thin air!

I completed most of what was requested.
